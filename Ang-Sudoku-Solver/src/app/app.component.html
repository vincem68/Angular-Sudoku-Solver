    <h1>Welcome to the Sudoku Solver!</h1>

    <h3>
        <p>This is a program that allows you to enter in your own Sudoku puzzle and solves it for you.</p>

        <p>Simply move your mouse over a space and you can type in any number from 1 through 9.</p>

        <p>If you're unfamiliar with Sudoku, a valid solution is one where every row, column, and 3x3 box
        has only one occurrence of every number 1 through 9. There can be no duplicate numbers in any of them.</p>

        <p>If you enter in a duplicate number in a row, box, or column, that space will turn red as well as any
        spaces with the duplicate number. The program will not solve it until all spaces are white.</p>

        <p>Simply click the Solve button when ready or the Clear button to reset the board.</p>

        <p><strong>Please note this is only for puzzles that have 1 unique solution!</strong></p>
