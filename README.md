# This is a solo project about solving Sudoku puzzles. 

The page displays a 9x9 Sudoku grid allowing the user to fill in the spaces with whatever numbers 1-9 they desire. When the Solve button is clicked, the program will solve the puzzle and display the solution within the grid. The project utilizes Angular principles such as components and services to have the spaces communicate with each other whenever a number is entered into the board. Spaces automatically update themselves to be red (invalid) or white (valid) depending on if numbers entered either go against or comply with the rules of Sudoku (no duplicate numbers in rows, columns or 3x3 boxes).

# This project was made in AngularJS, Typescript, HMTL and CSS.
